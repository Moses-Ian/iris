# Iris - Deep Learning

## Description

This is the final project in the course **Learn to use Python for Deep Learning with Google's latest Tensorflow 2 library and Keras!** on Udemy

Be sure to follow my page as I continue to study machine learning!

## Usage

Enter values of the sepal and petal legths and widths you find, and the AI will tell you what species of flower it is!

## Brief Explanation of the Neural Network Architecture

The layers are dense layers.

Input: 4

Hidden: 1 hidden layer of 4 neurons

Output: 3
